# task-one-
in this project we Motor drive design and implementation for robot arm
the project was implemented by Tinkercad program
equipments is: Arduino uno R3 , Breadboard small , and 5 Micro servo
the point is Design the electronic circuit to control 5 servo motors
first, Connect a wire frome Micro servo ground to negative point of the board
second, Connect a wire frome Micro servo power to 5V in the Arduino
Third, Connect a wire frome Micro servo signle to Digtal( PMW ) of the Arduino
Fourthly, Connect a wire frome Arduino GND to negative point of the board
fifth, We programmed a code to make all movements at (90) degree
